Every day many families across the globe struggle to feed their children a nutritious meal. In the world, 690 million people go to bed on an empty stomach each night, out of 7,713 million people. For the year 2019, 135 million people in 55 countries facing acute food insecurity.

Eradicating hunger and malnutrition is one of the greatest challenges of our time. The Goal 2 zero-hunger pledge to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture is the priority of the World food program (WFO).

Agriculture is the science/practice of farming, including the cultivation of the soil for growing crops and rearing animals to provide food and other products.
Eco-system is the interaction between energy, environment, and living organism.
Agro-system is an ecosystem managed to produce food and fibre.

Sustainable agriculture is the most needed alternative to conventional agriculture. The conventional agriculture long turn impact includes degrading topsoil, declining groundwater level, and reduced biodiversity. Itâ€™s vital to ensure nutrition security in climate constrained world.

Agroecology is an ecological approach to agriculture and is the science behind sustainable farming. Agroecological farming could be beneficial to end world hunger. It supports food production and food security and nutrition while restoring the ecosystem and biodiversity that are essential for sustainable agriculture.

Agroecological farming techniques can improve the resilience of the farming system by increasing diversification through poly cropping, agroforestry, integrated crop and livestock system, and the use of local varieties. This resilience can reduce the risk of pets and disease and the cost of seeds. The management of soil fertility through crop rotations, cover crops and manuring can increase soil water retention. Soil quality can be improved with a higher level of organic matter.

Agroecological farming supports small-scale farmers that are diverse, integrated, and use low levels of inputs to ensure a long-term balance between food production and sustainability of natural resources.

Sustainable farming is farming ecologically by promoting methods or practices that are economically viable, environmentally sound, and protect public health. Sustainable agriculture is a journey rather than a destination. The word sustain means to maintain, support, and endure. The sustainable farming methods or practices are Making use of renewable resources, Integrated pest management, Hydroponics and Aquaponics, Crop rotation, Polyculture farming, Permaculture, Avoid soil erosion, Crop diversity, Agroforestry, Food forest, Natural pest eliminators, Biodynamic farming, Managed grazing, Save transportation cost, Better water management, Removal of weeds manually, Growing heirloom and older varieties, and Urban agriculture.

Conclusion
Most Indian farmers depend on the yearly monsoon for irrigation. A bad monsoon-like too little rain, too much or untimely rain makes farmers unable to sow or harvest successfully. Sustainable agriculture is designed to assist such small farmers to cope with these challenges. 

Farmers must be given information and practical training on climate-smart farming practices and technologies. This will help farmers to conserve, manage soil and water resources, improve crop yields and reduce cultivation cost leading to higher income and fewer incidences of crop failure. The goal of sustainable agriculture is providing education, not only for farmers but for laborers, policymakers, researchers, retailers, and consumers. This makes farming less risky and a more sustainable livelihood now and in the future.
